# Ko-Fi Engine
Ko-Fi Engine is a 3D game engine based on SDL and OpenGL, developed by √Ålex √Åvila and Bosco Barber for the "Game Engines" subject in the Bachelor's degree in Video Game Design and Development at the CITM-UPC center, Barcelona.

# Brand-New Shaders Pipeline
From Version 3.0 fordward Ko-Fi Engine uses Shaders to render our game objects geometry into the scene.
##Features
- You can double click a shader in the assets window to open the in-engine text editor. You can write or modify your own shaders and save them.
- You can modify the shader uniform values through the inspector under the material menu item.
- You can change, delete or add textures to the material component and then use them on your shader.
- Editing a shader in-engine automatically compiles and applies the changes
- We have created a water shader for you to test and a default shader with a albedo texture and albedo tint.
- Compile error lines and messages are shown in the editor.

## Content
- A scene with some houses, a floor and lake is automatically loaded at the start.
- The user is able to use the inspector to modify a GameObject:
    - Hierarchy: delete, reparent, create empty and create children.
    - Transform: translate, rotate and scale Game Objects.
    - Mesh: select or drop any imported mesh.
    - Texture: select or drop any imported texture.
    - Camera is a component with settings that can be modified.
- All meshes use a bounding volume (AABB) and can be discarded using Frustum Culling. This process is visualized in the editor (debug raycast and boxes).
- Models, meshes and textures are saved to our own format (.sugar) under ‚ÄúLibrary‚Äù folder.
- Scene can be serialized to a file that can be loaded.
- The user can Start / Pause / Stop the simulation and recover its original state.
- Resource Management:
    - There is an ‚ÄúAssets‚Äù window that shows all user assets.
        - *as a simple tree viewer
    - The user can drop/import new files. Assets window reacts properly.
    - Asset files can be deleted through the window and /Library entries are removed.
    - Upon start, all resources not managed inside Assets are generated in Library.
        - */Library folder is regenerated from /Assets + meta content
    - All resources use reference counting (e.g. a texture / mesh is only once in memory regardless of how many gameobject use it). This process is visualized in the editor.

## Controls
- WASDQE = Move around the 3D space
- Shift + Move: Speed increase
- Right click: Camera Rotation
- Alt + Left click: Rotate around the object selected
- Mouse Wheel: Zoom
- F: Focus Object
- ESC: Exit engine
# Known Issues üößüöß
- Primitives do not work at the moment
- Frustum culling does not work after the shaders implementation due to projection rework.
- Text editor sometimes goes crazy and keeps the delete action active. Text editor has problems with ctrl commands.
- Importing objects from the assets directly can cause hierarchy selection problems
